      "title": "Introduction to Computer Science",
      "subject": "Computer Science",
      "content": "Computer Science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines, such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory, to practical disciplines including the design and implementation of hardware and software.\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n1. Algorithms: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science as they provide a systematic method for problem-solving. Common types include sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (binary search, linear search), and graph algorithms.\n\n2. Data Structures: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure has its own advantages and use cases.\n\n3. Programming Languages: A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Popular languages include Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and Go. Each language has its own syntax and semantics.\n\n4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code. The four pillars of OOP are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\n\n5. Database Systems: A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically. Database management systems (DBMS) allow users to create, read, update, and delete data. Common types include relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases.\n\n6. Computer Networks: A computer network is a group of computers that share resources located on or provided by network nodes. Networks can be classified by topology (star, ring, bus), by scale (LAN, WAN), or by technology (Ethernet, WiFi).\n\n7. Operating Systems: An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.\n\n8. Software Engineering: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It involves requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.\n\n9. Artificial Intelligence: AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. This includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data.\n\n10. Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It involves encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security policies."
